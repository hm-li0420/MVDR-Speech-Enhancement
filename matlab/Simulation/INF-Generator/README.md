# Generating Sensor Signals in Isotropic Noise Fields

Researchers in the signal processing community often require sensor signals that result from a spherically or cylindrically isotropic noise field for simulation purposes. Although it has been shown that these signals can be generated using a number of uncorrelated noise sources that are uniformly spaced on a sphere or cylinder, this method is seldom used in practice. In [1] we proposed different algorithms to generate sensor signals for an arbitrary one- and three-dimensional array that result from a spherically or cylindrically isotropic noise field. 

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the algorithms described in [1] and [2].
